          <h1>Problem Solving Blog</h1>
          <h2>A time when I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>

            <h3>What was the problem</h3>

              <p>The simplest problem I encountered was figuring out where to actually write my answers.</p>

            <h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>

              <p>I just kept trying until I grasped what was happening. Eventually I saw the tests for each individual kata (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and I used this to check what I was doing</p>

            <h3>How did you feel throughout the process</h3>

              <p>I was very frustrated for a long time, I think taking a step back to look at all the resources I have at my disposal before jumping into exercises will really benefit me.</p>

            <h3>What did you learn</h3>

              <p>What I learned was to use the resources I have at hand better. Also I need to read everything. For the last exercise deBee I didn't read where it said to split which took me off on a completely different tangent trying to find source material to learn how to use .replace. I do enjoy things like this though as it exposes me to different solutions to problems.</p>

          <h2>Elegantly solved a problem</h2>

            <h3>What was the problem?</h3>

              <p>I don't know if I can really call it elegant but I am pretty proud of it. My solution for the final deBee challenge used a different method than what was recommended and it actually works with only three small lines of code.</p>

            <h3>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>

              <p>There was a large amount of googling for this. I think I had four different tabs open dedicated to trying to figure out what I am trying to do. 
                I also used pseudocode to break it down into smaller steps. 
                This helped a lot, at one point I had removed buzz and buzz with any form of capitalization but the string returned had all these spaces in it so the second test wasn't passing. 
                I then had to research how to remove additional spaces from a returned string.
                The process looked a bit like this, with my pseudocode being the test pass or fails from the npm.</p>

                <p style="color: green">
                  // returning a string now. [✓]<br>
                  // make the string return where word buzz has been removed [X]<br>
                  // make the string return where word buzz has been removed, regardless of captialization [X]<br>
                    <br>
                  function deBee(sentence) {<br>
                    return sentence}<br>
                </p>

                <p>Then I had to google how to remove a word from string and I stumbled upon this site
                  <a href="https://community.make.com/t/how-do-i-remove-words-from-a-string-if-they-appear-in-an-array/39449/5" target="_blank">here</a>
                   which showed me how to use .replace to search for words and replace them with '', or nothing.
                  After this I was almost done and had something that looked like this:
                </p>

                <p style="color: green">
                  // returning a string now. [✓]<br>
                  // make the string return where word buzz has been removed [X]<br>
                  // make the string return where word buzz has been removed, regardless of captialization [✓]<br>
                    <br>
                  function deBee(sentence) {<br>
                    return sentence<br>
                    .replace(/\bbuzz\b/gi, '')<br>
                  }<br>
                </p>
                <p>the \b is a word boundary anchor which shows where the word starts or ends, 
                  thinking back maybe I could use this and have something like \b" " + buzz + " "\b to remove the spaces. 
                  Could be cool if it works.
                  The /g is a global flag which just means it checks everything for buzz, and 'i' makes it ignore case so will match both uppercase and lowercase versions of buzz, eg:
                    <ul>
                      <li>buzz</li>
                      <li>Buzz</li>
                      <li>BUZZ</li>
                      <li>bUZz</li>
                    </ul></p>
               
                <p>Still not complete though as the second test wasn't passing and when I looked at why I saw this:<br>
                  <br>
                 <span style="color: green"> - Expected</span><br>
                 <span style="color: red">+ Received</span><br>
                <br>
                <span style="color: green"> - Help! I'm surrounded by bees!!</span><br>
                <span style="color: red; white-space: pre;">+ Help!   I'm    surrounded    by    bees!!</span><br>
                </p>

                <p>So I had successfully removed buzz and Buzz and any form of capitalized buzz but not the blank spaces left by the words or at the start and end of the string.</p>

                <p>This led me <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-replace-multiple-spaces-with-single-space-in-javascript/" target="_blank">Here</a>
                and showed me how to replace multiple spaces in a string with one single space and also the .trim(); to remove spaces at the start and end of a sentence and left me with this:</p>
                
                <p style="color: green">
                  // returning a string now. [✓]<br>
                  // make the string return where word buzz has been removed [✓]<br>
                  // make the string return where word buzz has been removed, regardless of captialization [✓]<br>
                    <br>
                  function deBee(sentence) {<br>
                    return sentence<br>
                    .replace(/\bbuzz\b/gi, '')<br>
                    .replace(/\s+/g, ' ')<br>
                    .trim();<br>
                  }
                </p>
                <p>With all tests passing</p>

            <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>

              <p>Incredibly frustrated at times. I am still not very good at console logging anything. So I relied on the npm to help see if what I was doing was working, which probably added a lot of extra time to the process. In saying this though, I feel very accomplished.</p>

            <h3>What did you learn</h3>

              <p>I learnt that there are multiple ways to solve a problem and that I should learn to read better. No but in all seriousness I learnt that I can figure out how to solve problems with the little knowledge I have through problem solving techniques. One thing that I am really glad I figured out is how to add properties to the value of other children properties. I struggled for a long time writing huge multi lines of code to try get this to work to then figure out that it is one simple line, this was a theme throughout the whole challenge.</p>

          <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>

            <ul>
              <li>Pseudocode - 8/10</li>
              <li>Trying something - 10/10</li>
              <li> Rubber ducky method - 5/10</li>
              <li>Reading error messages - 6/10</li>
              <li>Console.logging - 3/10</li>
              <li>Googling - 10/10</li>
              <li>Asking your peers for help - 5/10</li>
              <li>Asking coaches for help - 4/10</li>
              <li>Improving your process with reflection - 8/10</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Googling is probably my best problem-solving technique which I am not too happy about. I am also confident to just try something and then figure it out from there. Areas I need to improve on would be googling less and being more willing to reach out to my peers and instructors for help.</p>

          <h2>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h2>

            <p>I think it is something I struggle with on a broader scale. 
              I see people posting their blogs days before me and being already finished with the Kata and it makes me shell up as I feel that I am way behind.
              Next time I'm just going to send in whatever I need to.</p>
