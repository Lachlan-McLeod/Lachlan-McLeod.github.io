        <ol class="card2">
          <li>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.<br>
          In my previous job a job I was in charge of went wrong and there were some large financial repurcussions. It technically wasn't my fault but I took responsibility for it and came up with the solution.
          I think ethically, because I was in charge it is my responsibility, I had to think hard on the ramifications for owning up but I am glad I did, I was not met with anger and the client happily contributed to the solution.</li>
          <li>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.<br>
          My people are hard workers, they are the type of people to get stuff done no matter what. I think this has instilled a value of determination for me. No matter what is going on you just have to get on with it and get it done 
          no matter what the obstacles in the way might be.</li>
          <li>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.<br>
          I am quite a resourceful person, I will exhaust all avenues I know in order to find an answer to a problem I have. This coupled with my determination to get things finished really help me to stay on task until it is complete.</li>
          <li>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?<br>
          I think I struggle at times with collaboration as mentioned earlier. There looks to be a lot of peer to peer learning so I will need to step up in this regard and really make an effort to put myself out there.</li>
          <li>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
           Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.<br>
           My old workplace was filled with veterans of the industry, this meant I, coming in with 3-4 years of experience and being their leader, would often get challenged on my decisions.
           I think the best thing I did was listen to them. They all had specific skill sets and I would feed off their knowledge but would also try to feed what I knew back to them. 
           Lots of times there were situations where they challenged what I wanted them to do, my way of navigating this was to really just explain my thinking behind it in an open setting and take onboard what they were saying. 
           It was definitely challenging at times but I did have to stick to my guns and tell them that I get where they are coming from but it needs to be done the way I am explaining.</li>
