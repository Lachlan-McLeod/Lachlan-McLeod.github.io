      <h3>Differences between IQ and EQ</h3>
      <p>IQ is the measure of a persons intellectual ability. Commonly misconcieved as a measure of how smart a person is, IQ actually relates to a persons ability to:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Use logic to solve problems.</li>
          <li>Plan and implement strategy.</li>
          <li>Understand abstract ideas.</li>
          <li>Learn from and adapt to change.</li>
          <li>Grasp and use language.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>EQ generally refers to how well you sense emotion in yourself and also other people. It impacts how you communicate with other people and the world around you. People with a higher EQ may find it easier to:
          <ul>
            <li>Identify emotions within themselves and the emotions of the people around them.</li>
            <li>Show empathy, this is because they have an awareness of how other people are feeling and understand when to show empathy.</li>
            <li>Adapt feelings and behaviour to different situations.</li>
            <li>Be less impulsive. People who understand their own emotions better are more likely to understand what situations to put themselves in so as to not be impulsive.</li>
            <li>Withstand temptations and delay gratification. This relates directly to being less impulsive as giving in to temptation is to be more impulsive.</li>
            <li>Resolve conflicts. Higher EQ means you will generally have a greater grasp on how people are feeling in different scenarios which can tailor responses to aid in conflict resolution.</li>
            <li>Communicate effectively. People with a higher EQ can garner how to better communicate with people as they better understand how that person is feeling.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>My understanding of Emotional Intelligence</h3>
        <p>Emotional intelligence to me boils down to a few small things. 
          I think it's about how well you understand how other people feel in any situation. <br>
          People with a higher EQ are better able to communicate in the world as they can put themselves in the shoes of other people and be empathetic.<br>
           I also think it's about understanding yourself and how you yourself understand, process and express your feelings.<br>
           It is an essential skill for building relationships with other people, 
           understanding yourself and what your needs are and to deal with stress.</p>
