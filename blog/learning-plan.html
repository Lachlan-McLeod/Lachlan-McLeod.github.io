          <li>What is your long term goal or career pathway? <br>
            My long term career goals are to become a senior developer for the company I hopefully end up working for. 
            I also want to find a company that really fits my personality. </li>
          <li>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning? <br>
            I like to believe I am quite technically minded, 
            having worked in an engineering role before I quickly picked up the skills required and later became a mentor for others wishing to follow suit.</li>
          <li>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?<br>
            Collaboration for sure. I love working with people but I have found that I tend to get engrossed in what I am doing
            and end up shutting people out to a certain extent. This is something I want to change. Hearing from friends in the industry
            there seems to be a strong focus on peer programming. This is where you are "buddied" up with another developer 
            to work through challenges together. </li>
            <li>My commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme.<br>
            I have a routine in place that I am trying to stick to in order to manage my productivity. 
            Every hour I have been getting up to do 10 squats and 10 push ups to reset my brain.
            It also gives a brief reset to my brain to reflect on what I have been doing for the past hour.
            When things are building up and getting to me I also take a break, get a coffee and chill for 10 minutes.
            During this time I don't think about the work at all. So far this has worked well and I've come back
            to my desk refreshed and with ideas on how to solve the problem.</li>
            <li>My commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way.<br>
            I struggle with reaching out for help. I have always preferred to try engage my brain as much as possible 
            to work through the solution. I think I do need to be careful though as I don't want to end up going down
            an avenue where I have to turn to ChatGPT or the like to solve a problem. I will reach out for help if I need it
            via the discord channel and from my peers in the programme with me.</li>
            <li>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.<br>
            I think so far the Facilitation team have been great. The flipped learning is definitely my preferred method 
            to learn so I'm super happy in that regard. Having the team there to reach out to if I need help is really comforting
            and I intend to make use of this.</li>
            <li>Scheduling Information.<br>
            Aside from the 16/01 to 21/01, I will not have any scheduling issues.</li>
