      <p>Updated Learning plan
        <ul>
            <li>I think my expecatations of my learning needs and areas I need to grow in, were pretty well founded. I didn't write any limitations upon reflection, but I have definitely experienced them in these past 5 weeks.<br>
            My biggest limitation is the fear of embarrassment. This leads me to not speak up when I don't fully understand something.</li>
            <li>I have surprised myself with my tenacity. I have had a few unexpected events occur throughout bootcamp so far and I think I have managed to stay on top of my workload reasonably well. I have also learned that I am still able to learn which is awesome.<br>
            This was a worry for me as I wasn't sure what kmy ability to absorb new information would be like after already having gone to school and worked a different career so that has been a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>I think I am still having trouble asking questions sometimes. I need to speak up when I don't understand something. It's something you just have to do. My facilitators and other students in my cohort are amazing and supportive so it really is just a me problem.</li>
            <li>I have definitely felt the benefits of following my wellbeing plan. Going for daily walks, taking a break to read, being in my garden, these have all helped to keep my head clear and focus me on the important things in my life as well as keeping me feeling refreshed.</li>

        <p>The walls of my whare that I think need strengthening are Taha Wairua. I haven't been journalling as much as I would have liked to. I found alot of benefits to journalling so it's something I really want to focus on.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>My key needs at the moment are family connection. A lot of my family is moving away to other countries very soon so I have been juggling flying all around New Zealand lately. This coupled with the need to find a job after bootcamp is definitely causing some anxiety.</li>
          <li>My stress profile looks like me shutting down a bit. I tend to go quiet and get quite reserved. I focus pretty much solely on what is causing me stress until I resolve whatever it is causing me that stress.</li>
          <li>I think waking up earlier is a wellbeing experiment I want to try. I prefer colder weather and being outside when it is brisk so I want to try getting up at 5:30 - 6:00am and just spending some time outside with a nice hot cup of tea and just recharging each morning before getting into my day.</li>
